## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I just learnt a bit more about flexbox via the Scrimba learning platform, so this was a good chance to put some of what I learnt into practice!

### Continued development

The biggest sticking point for me was trying to figure out how to position the image properly. I've read a bit about the  `position` property in the past, but I've never practiced at length with it, so I'm still a bit shaky on it. I would very much like to work on more projects where I can use this!

Also, I really like using Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [CSS Layout - The position Property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - This helped me understand a bit more about the `position` property
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) - I'm currently enrolled in their [Frontend Developer Career Path Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) and have learnt a great deal. They have other interesting courses I'd like to take afterwards (**Learn CSS Animations** sounds fun!)
